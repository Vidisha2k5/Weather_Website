## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If you don't see the Weather Mood section:**

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12):
   ```javascript
   console.log(document.getElementById('weatherMoodSection'));
   ```
   Should return the element, not null.

2. **Verify CSS Loading**:
   ```javascript
   const el = document.getElementById('weatherMoodSection');
   console.log(window.getComputedStyle(el).background);
   ```
   Should show rgba background.

3. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   ```
   Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
   Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   ```

4. **Check File Contents**:
   - `index.html` should have Weather Mood section around line 110
   - `styles.css` should have `.weather-mood-section` styles around line 1308
   - `script.js` should have `updateWeatherMoodUI` function around line 1287
