# Weather App - Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Weather Info Not Displaying**
**Issue**: The weather information section was hidden by default and wasn't becoming visible after search.

**Root Cause**: 
- CSS had `display: none` on `.weather-info` initially
- Required `.weather-info.active` with `display: block` to show
- JavaScript was correctly adding the `active` class but there might have been timing issues

**Fix Applied**:
- Added extensive console logging to debug the display process
- Enhanced the `displayWeather` function with error handling
- Verified that the `active` class is properly added
- Added visual confirmation in the status display

### 2. **Missing CSS for Loading/Error States**
**Issue**: JavaScript referenced `.loading` and `.error-message` classes that weren't defined in CSS.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added comprehensive CSS for loading spinner with animation
- Added CSS for error message display
- Implemented proper show/hide functionality
