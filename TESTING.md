# 🌤️ Smart Weather App - Testing Guide

A modern, interactive weather application that provides accurate weather data for your current location along with intelligent outfit recommendations, mood-based UI, and a visually engaging interface.

## ✨ Key Features

### ✅ Live Weather Data 
Get real-time weather information including temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, visibility, and weather condition — all fetched dynamically for your location using the OpenWeatherMap API.

### 🧥 Intelligent Outfit Recommendations 
Based on current weather and wind conditions, the app recommends suitable clothing such as heavy coats, gloves, scarves, or light jackets. Users are guided on how to dress smartly for the day.

### 🎨 Mood-Based Weather UI 
The background, color palette, and even animations change dynamically based on the weather:
- ❄️ **Snow** = Cool purples with snowflake animation and soft tones
- ☔ **Rain** = Dark blue background with animated raindrops and relaxing music
- ☀️ **Sunny** = Bright yellow/orange gradient with sunshine icons

### 📱 Responsive & Clean Design 
Fully mobile-friendly, with a smooth layout that adapts across devices. The color combinations are carefully chosen for contrast, readability, and mood-matching.

### 🎵 Optional Weather-Based Soundtracks 
Adds immersive music that matches the weather — chill vibes for rain, calm piano for snow, or upbeat tunes for sunshine (optional toggle).

## 🖼️ Visual Style & Color Palette

- 🌈 Vibrant gradients and soft-glass (glassmorphism) effects
